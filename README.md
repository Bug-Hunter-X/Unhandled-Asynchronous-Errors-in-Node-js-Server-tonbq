# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: improperly handling asynchronous errors within HTTP request handlers.  The provided `bug.js` showcases a server that performs an asynchronous operation. If this operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but the client receives no response, leading to a poor user experience.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected version that gracefully handles the error and sends an appropriate response to the client.

## Problem:

The original code lacks comprehensive error handling for asynchronous operations. If the `asyncOperation` function rejects, the error is caught, logged, but no response is sent back to the client.  This leaves the client hanging indefinitely. 

## Solution:

The solution implements proper error handling by sending an error response (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) to the client in case of an asynchronous failure. This ensures a more robust and user-friendly server.  The server now always responds, providing feedback to the client, regardless of success or failure of the asynchronous operation.
